An example app, heavily inspired by Lonley Planet, to demonstrate some of the capabilites of Sass.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs project dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Branches

### `01-start`

The barebones skeleton of the app. Contains some markup, data and images.

### `02-sass-boilerplate`

The Sass boilerplate has been added as well as the `sass` npm package.

### `03-layouts`

The app is a blank canvas ready to start adding layouts.

### `04-components`

Layouts have been created, ready to start adding components and their styles.

### `05-final`

The app in it's final state, layouts and components are styled. Variables can be tweaked to change the look and feel of the app.

## Challenge

The app in it's current state isn't very responsive, this is bad!! Have a go at using what you've learnt so far to make the app responsive. Remember to use the breakpoint mixin, good luck!
